Once you have cloned the project, you have to run `npm install` in order to download your `node_modules` folder

## Development server

For the development, you can run either `ng serve` or `npm start` for a dev server.
Then navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

To get the production package ready, you have to run `ng build` or `npm run build` to build the project.
The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

- `components` folder: contains every reusable components
- `pages` folder: contains components used for routing

The routing rules can be found at `src/app/app-routing.module.ts`.

Good luck!
